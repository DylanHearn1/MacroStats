# MacroStats

Deployed site: https://macro.dylanhearn.co.uk/

## MacroStats is a web app created using React, TS, Tailwind.

The goal of the app was to easily track both calories and macros from food. To ensure a user friendly layout the app fetches data from the users request of food item and weight, and simply returns the stats of said query. The app takes care of the rest by calculating all of the calories, protein etc in a simple and easy to read format.
